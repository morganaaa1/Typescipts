Sure, here are comments for the code:

// Declare a variable called "username" and assign it the value "Ali"
let username = 'Ali'

// Log the value of "username" to the console
console.log(username)

// Declare variables "a", "b", and "c" and assign them the values of 12, 6, and 2, respectively
let a: number = 12
let b: number = 6
let c: number = 2

// Log the result of dividing "a" by "b" to the console
console.log(a / b)

// Log the result of multiplying "c" and "b" to the console
console.log(c * b)
